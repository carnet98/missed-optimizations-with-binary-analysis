Title: Missing Loop Optimization for Unexecuted Loop

In the following code the for-loop is never executed because 'a' is initialized to zero. GCC -O3 and -Os compile to a loop while clang is able to optimize.

static int a = 0;
static char b;
short(c)(short d, short e) { return d - e; }
int foo() {
    for (; a; a = c(a, 7))
        ;
    return a;
}
