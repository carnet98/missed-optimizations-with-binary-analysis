Title: Loop is vectorized instead of removed

This simple for-loop is compiled to complex vectorized code instead of optmizing the loop like clang is able to.

unsigned short a;
int main() {
    int counter = 0;
    // n and a are mutliples of 4
    int n = 4;
    a *= n;
    for (; a > 0; a += n)
        counter++;
    return counter;
}
